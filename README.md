# ID3
ID3 Implementation for Cognitive Science (CS 390L)



IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES BY HARLEY
if you make a Table capable of holding N elements you better fill it up.
i didnt bother to check what happens when it isnt full so it probably breaks

everything is unsafe and there are redundancies everywhere. sorry.

code sanitation changelog:
moved the test from table into a new file (test 3).
moved bucket and bucketmanager to their own .java files.
renamed classes such that they start with a capital letter.
